/// DEFECT B — a disposed <see cref="OrderBook"/> still throws on the mutation entry points the
/// connectors reach INLINE from the socket thread, so a book disposed by a reconnect turns the very
/// next in-flight frame into a NullReferenceException.
///
/// The read side is already guarded: <c>GetBidsSnapshot</c> (VisualHFT.Commons/Model/OrderBook.cs:155),
/// <c>GetAsksSnapshot</c> (OrderBook.cs:192) and <c>CalculateMetrics</c> (OrderBook.cs:307) all bail on
/// <c>Volatile.Read(ref _disposed)</c> and return empty rather than throw. <c>DeleteLevel(..)</c>
/// (OrderBook.cs:824) is the write-side PRECEDENT, not a defect: it already re-checks the side list for
/// null INSIDE the write lock (OrderBook.cs:834-837 and :844-847) and returns, and it did so before
/// this branch. <c>CalculateMetrics</c> does the same at OrderBook.cs:314. The remaining write paths do
/// not:
///   * <c>Clear()</c>              OrderBook.cs:630 -> InternalClear() -> <c>_data.Asks.Count()</c> (:434)
///   * <c>AddOrUpdateLevel(..)</c> OrderBook.cs:656 -> <c>_list.Count()</c> on the null side list (:676)
///   * <c>AddLevel(..)</c>         OrderBook.cs:699 -> <c>list.Count()</c> on the null side list (:717)
///   * <c>UpdateLevel(..)</c>      OrderBook.cs:776 -> <c>.Update(..)</c> on the null side list (:786)
/// while <c>OrderBookData.Dispose</c> (VisualHFT.Commons/Model/OrderBookData.cs:244-262) nulls
/// <c>_Bids</c>/<c>_Asks</c> under the write lock.
///
/// DEFECT C — the sibling sweep stopped short. Three more entry points take the SAME write lock and
/// dereference the SAME side lists with no guard of any kind, neither a <c>_disposed</c> pre-check nor
/// an in-lock re-check:
///   * <c>Reset()</c>          OrderBook.cs:649 -> InternalClear() -> <c>_data.Asks.Count()</c> (:434)
///   * <c>UpdateSnapshot(..)</c> OrderBook.cs:466 -> <c>_data.Clear()</c> (:471) -> <c>foreach (var item in _Asks)</c> (OrderBookData.cs:202)
///   * <c>LoadData(..)</c>     OrderBook.cs:320 -> <c>_data.Clear()</c> (:325) -> the same OrderBookData.cs:202
/// These are not exotic paths: <c>LoadData</c> and <c>UpdateSnapshot</c> are how a REST or websocket
/// SNAPSHOT is applied, which is precisely what a reconnect does immediately after the book map was
/// torn down, and <c>Reset()</c> is the recycle path. The fix is the one-line in-lock re-check the
/// other four now carry.
///
/// TWO defects live here, and they need two shapes of test.
///
/// (1) SEQUENTIAL — one thread, dispose then mutate. <c>Clear()</c> and <c>AddOrUpdateLevel(..)</c>
/// answer this today via their <c>Volatile.Read(ref _disposed)</c> pre-check; <c>DeleteLevel</c> answers
/// it via its in-lock null re-check. Pinned by the four <c>_OnADisposedBook_</c> tests below.
///
/// (2) THE RACE — the pre-check is check-then-act OUTSIDE the lock. A socket thread reads
/// <c>_disposed == false</c>, is descheduled, and a reconnect thread runs
/// <c>OrderBookData.Dispose</c>: flag set, write lock taken, <c>_Bids</c>/<c>_Asks</c> nulled, lock
/// released. The socket thread resumes PAST its own guard, takes the write lock and dereferences null.
/// A pre-lock flag read cannot close that window — only a null re-check INSIDE the lock can, which is
/// exactly what <c>DeleteLevel</c> and <c>CalculateMetrics</c> already do. <c>AddLevel</c> and
/// <c>UpdateLevel</c> are worse still: they carry no guard at all and are called directly on possibly
/// disposed books by CoinbaseL3 (MarketConnectors.CoinbaseL3/CoinbasePlugin.cs:688, :701, :1021, :1034)
/// and ReplayEngine (MarketConnectors.ReplayEngine/ReplayEnginePlugin.cs:1296, :1309).
///
/// The four <c>_WhenTheDisposeLandsAfterTheGuardPassed_</c> tests reproduce that window
/// deterministically, without threads: dispose the book for real (side lists null, flag true), then put
/// the private <c>_disposed</c> flag back to <c>false</c> by reflection. That is precisely the state a
/// thread which has already passed the pre-check observes, and it is unreachable by any pre-lock flag
/// read — so only an in-lock null re-check on all four write paths turns these green.
///
/// Why it matters here: Bitfinex applies snapshot and delta frames inline on the socket thread
/// (<c>BitfinexPlugin.UpdateOrderBookSnapshot</c> -> <c>lob.Clear()</c> then <c>AddOrUpdateLevel</c>),
/// and <c>ClearAsync</c> disposes every book in <c>_localOrderBooks</c> during a reconnect. The
/// exception type and message shape produced by that window are identical to the production storm
/// measured on v0.1.11 (309 error events, 2 users) — "Unhandled error while receiving delta market
/// data for BTC/USD" with a NullReferenceException.
///
/// Contract under test: every mutation entry point behaves like the read side — a book whose side lists
/// are gone silently ignores the frame (no throw, no state change), whether the caller learned that
/// before or after it passed the guard, while a LIVE book still applies all of them.
